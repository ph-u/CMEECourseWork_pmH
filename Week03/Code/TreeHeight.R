## This function calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top, using the trigonometric formula
## height = distance * tan(radians)
## arguments
## degrees: The angle of elevation of tree
## distance: the distance from base of tree (e.g. metres)
## output
## the heights of the tree, same units as "distance"
