low-level computational language: communication with machine, binary; for generation of ref libraries
"#" pre-processor libraries
shell read "main" function
return: return operator
space in C very flexible

step of compile
0. preprocessor: textual substitutions -> perform constant arithmetric substitutions
1. compiler: translate code -> assembly -> binary -> output: object file (binary compiler code)
2. linker: create excutables (e.g. exe; link all relatibles & fix symbols); skip when writing libraries
