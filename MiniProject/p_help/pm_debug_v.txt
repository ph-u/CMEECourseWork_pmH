Landslide site: logic error

lib: useless lib called

functions: clear

write NLLS as functions: logic error
1. lm only need one per dataset -- no need parameters, model according data points, no errorbars needed
2. nlsLM is a test function, no need to be called within a function
3. Hence this section should be lower than getting starting values section

get starting values: logic error + warning
- resultant plot are log-lin graphs
- eliminate recursively the max y-axis is computationally correect but logically unsupportive
