ecological neutral theory
assume all individuals eco equ
see how this assumption get results
mutation balance out extinction
zero sum assumption
- isolated system, no migrations
- can be relaxed, little population fluctuation

point mutation speciation, protracted speciation, polyploidy speciation
spatial structure non-existing / implicit (metacommunity & local) / spatially explicit network / fully spatially explicit (voter model)

null model: statistically aim to beat
demographic properties of an individual are independent of its species identity
an individual die not because of ecology
a model in which species are interchangeable is neutral (no janzen-connell model -- crowdness affect fitness)

voter model
neutral probability
spread to nearest neighbours only
impenetrable clumps formation
edge effect presence
introduce mutation
