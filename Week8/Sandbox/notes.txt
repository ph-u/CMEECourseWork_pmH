ecological neutral theory
assume all individuals eco equ
see how this assumption get results
mutation balance out extinction
zero sum assumption
- isolated system, no migrations
- can be relaxed, little population fluctuation

Summary
1. assume demographic properties of an individual independent of sp identity
2. understand / predicting at one time
3. explain sp-area relationship & other spatial biodiv pattern
4. 
5. toolbox only

point mutation speciation, protracted speciation, polyploidy speciation
spatial structure non-existing / implicit (metacommunity & local) / spatially explicit network / fully spatially explicit (voter model)

null model: statistically aim to beat
demographic properties of an individual are independent of its species identity
an individual die not because of ecology
a model in which species are interchangeable is neutral (no janzen-connell model -- crowdness affect fitness)

voter model
neutral probability
spread to nearest neighbours only
impenetrable clumps formation
edge effect presence
introduce mutation

-------------------
biased dice vs unbiased dice (neutral theory)
realism (model explain reality) & instrumentalism (model inspire thoughts on reality) perspectives
input parameters into models: sufficient is enough
anagenesis: sister species on mainland -- migrate & local speciation
cladogenesis: sister species & target all on island only -- radiation speciation on island (little immigration, spatial occupations)
more isolation, less impact bring by immigration species, better do endemic spp do
too many parameters, over fitting

-------------------
coalescence
trace back time, found all speciation events
always in eqm condition
result vector of abundances, length(n) = number of spp in current condition
J: sample size
N: community / lineage size of interest
simulations not reality
(N-1)/(J-1): proportion of the lineage come from any place from the previous time step (can be from outside of target community of interest)
probability: v + (N-1)/(J-1)*(1-v) + [nothing happen] = 1
decrease chance of coalescence when going back in time
