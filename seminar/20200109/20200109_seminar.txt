gene exchange dynamics across lineages
scale & complexity

1. genotypes & phenotypes: virulence strains - chance or advantages
2. transmission chains
3. reconstruction of epidemics & outbreaks
4. metagenomics / microbiomes

antibiotic apocalypse
vertical evolution
horizontal evo: conjugation, transduction, transformation
component of genes in every individuals of a species: core genome = 100%
core vs accossory genome
all bacteria can be infected by phages, some antimicrobial genes mediated by phages

date mutation in clonal organisms
tree calibrated by time
drug out, TB almost immediately develop resistance (timestamp match)

remove recombination regions
phylogenetic dated
circulated in the hospital for years before being recognized
ICU patient over-represented

transmission through carrier, environment
patient who was blamed not involved in the outbreak

K. pneumoniae
varied in resistome for virulence phylogeny
plasmids dominant of resistence phenotype
plasmid component; copy number of plasmids
KPC element jumping between plasmids: transposon
patient X has a virulence plasmid but didn't spread

dynamics of gains and loss of plasmids
count number of copy number variation; low copy number plasmids (1-10); can host quite a high number of same plasmid
hold more number of same plasmids higher resistance?
bacteria can mediate resistance by modifying copy number of certain plasmids?

meaningful scheme to apply in clinic?
what is the classification for worriness to certain strains?

clinics workflow on dignostics often too simplistic and hence wrong

loss flanking region = loss of mibility in transposon
progressive decay: gradually lossing flanking regions upon each transposing activity
phylogenetic influence: root deeper in the phylogeny
local alignment method -> date local transmission events
complete mobile transposons more in env, decayed ones more in clinic -> from pigfarms transmit to clinic

host GC content matching plasmid GC content -> plasmid adapting to host genome
sharing GC, ori of replication -> lots of natural small groupings
plasmid don't jump too far, transposon actively in long-range HGT
many bacteria fir a "Russian doll model": genes > transposons > plasmids > bacterial individual host > bacterial spp / lineages
bacterial genes can spread at super-pace

focus on virulence elements instead of host
move away from strain-typing
textbook: high copy number plasmid small in size, low copy number plasmid have mechanisms to allocate in both daughter cells
methylation pattern influencing transposon insertion seq -> insertion fossilizing flanking regions -> loss of flanking regions
no more than one plasmid carrying same gene in the same cell?

phylogenetically deep = basal
China sample quite deep in phylogeny -> probably be the origin
