"ATP synthase in pathogenic bacteria - Structural investigations into a novel drug target"
Julis Demmer, (Meier lab) Imperial College

rise of Ab-resis bacteria
priority pathogen list for R&D - WHO
bedaquiline binding to ATP synthase F0 subunit: specific to prokaryotes
Acinetobacter baumanii
fragile mambrane protein: purification difficult
culture expression > purification > activity assay & inhibitor screening > negative stain TEM > ... > 3D model
plasmid design & expression
- native purification
- limit amount
- solubilisation challenging
- only transiently stable
- pBBR-MCS3
- affinity Tag purification
peptidisc reconstitution: more stable protein via detergent treatment
rotational / conformational states
120-deg rotation sub-states

ATP synthase hydrolysis activity assay & inhibitor screening
DCCD <> c subunit as inhibitor (known)
NaAz <> alpha subunit as inhibitor (known)

autoinhibition by subunit epsilon
opening & closing of beta subunit by rotational conformation change
open, false-open, close position for beta-subunit in the clockwise-rotating from top (synthesis; anti-clockwise for hydrolysis, naturally inhibited by epsilon subunit)
ligand binding
Cryo-CM structure with bound inhibitor

chloroplast ATP synthase a bit different in mechanism
distinguish in cryo-em map between peptidisc & protein structure -> no artifact

"Understanding how gut microbiota-mediated colonisation resistance prevents intestinal colonisation by pathogens"
Julie McDonald, Lecturer CMBI Imperial College

colonisation-resistance
- production of metabolites: SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids)
- outcompete
- bactericides
- modify metabolites (weaponisation)

gut as reservoir for MDROs (multidrug-resistant organisms)
restore microbiota of healthy people
FMT: faecal microbiota transplantation
current solely relying on FMT donors

aim: novel therapy
Ab-treated people has super high (40%) Enterobactericeae than healthy ppl (0-0.5%)
Ab change a lot in metabolites from microbiota
Ab have no effect on colonisation; FMT has eqm impact in microbiota on population of pathogens
succinate as general indicator of invasion: high when invaded
