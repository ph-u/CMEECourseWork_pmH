Sex, Drugs & Ecosystem Services: the paradox of plant roxins in nectar

floral & nectar chemistry
2 research labs
volatile chemicals: mating distruptions, insect behaviour

decline of pollinators
food security
interactive effects of stressors
some eco & human put stresses

most secondary metabolites in just one species
pollen higher chemical richness than nectar
pollen has high fold of sec metabolites
chemistry consistent across tissue types
- protect plant from pests
- also put into fruit rewards towards mutualists?
- important to adapt in pollinator & lead to advantages

mediating pollinator specialization, parasite load
anti-micro
protect against nectar robbers
modify pollinator behaviour (push-pull): attract pollinator when fertile, repel pollinator when fruit developing

non-target effect
spill-over of toxin to pollinator
smaller and fewer male bumble bees

filter mechanisms
positive correlation with toxins and fitness in native area, opposite to invaded area
pollinator syndrome: morphology and/or chemical filtering on pollinators
pollen / nectar have chemicals mediate parasites (stop aquistration / establishment) transmitted across bees

learning & memory important to pollinator
associate with colour, shape, scent of flower for successful foraging
caffeine enhances memory (depolarize membrane, long-term memory, hard to un-learn, effective drugging bees) of odour cues associated with food at natural concentration, over several days
increase effectiveness & decrease deciding time in bees
