1. climate change: one of the major threats to mordern biodiversity
2. need better forecast
3. interacting spp have similar TPC

goals
1. know physiology response to climate change in longer timescales
2. know cause of bio-variation, more accurate predictions
3. test metabolic theory on scale of species evolution

method
1. how traits response -- thermal performance curves shift

2. Sharpe-Schoolfield model
2.1 numerator: activation energy; raising TPC section
2.2 denominator: capture how fast performance declines
2.3 basic assumption: bio-growth rate of a trait under Tk influence on single rate-limiting enzyme
2.4 4 parameters: thermal optimal, thermal sensitivity, deactivation energy, trait basal value
2.5 2 estimated parameters: performance peak, Tk diff between optimal & 50% performance

outline
1. influence of thermodynamic constraints on TPC shape

thermal specialist vs generalist: -ve correlation between TPC-peak (B|pk) ; diff Tk of peak & 50% perfornance (W|op)
phytoplankton growth rate from literatures
phylogenetic regression
very week thermal specialist pattern

2 correlations
-ve slope of rise & optimal Tk
weak correlation between T|op & max performance

body/cell size weekly -ve correlate with peak of TPC

max performance weakly in with T|op
some var drive by cell vol
var involve in cell envelop
phytoplankton being specialist-generalist tradeoff TPC
____________
2. evolutionary pattern of thermal sensitivity

big debate in literature
- sensitivity not vary across spp
- thermal sesitivity has a distribution across spp

prey traits lower thermal sensitivity than predators' (life-dinner principle)

expected fix because of thermodynamical strength

H1: (align with metabolic theory) thermal sensitivity evolve tightly around optimal value [set by thermaldynamical strength]

H2: weak thermodynamical strength constraints

H3: certain clades have higher evolutionary rates upon thermal sensitivity letting them explore parameter space

phytoplankton, prokaryote dataset

thermal sensitivity across phylogeny

result: diff lineages overlap in thermal sensitivity parameter space
env select for thermal sensitivity

rate of evo on thermal sensitivity patchy
random burst of evo

expand of trait value space throughout evolutionary timescale
big jumps occurs for close lineages
prokaryotes generally evo/migrate to lower thermal sensitivity
__________
3. big picture of thermal adaptation
