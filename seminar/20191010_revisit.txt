1. climate change: one of the major threats to mordern biodiversity
2. need better forecast
3. interacting spp have similar TPC

goals
1. know physiology response to climate change in longer timescales
2. know cause of bio-variation, more accurate predictions
3. test metabolic theory on scale of species evolution

method
1. how traits response -- thermal performance curves shift

2. Sharpe-Schoolfield model
2.1 numerator: activation energy; raising TPC section
2.2 denominator: capture how fast performance declines
2.3 basic assumption: bio-growth rate of a trait under Tk influence on single rate-limiting enzyme
2.4 4 parameters: thermal optimal, thermal sensitivity, deactivation energy, trait basal value
2.5 2 estimated parameters: performance peak, Tk diff between optimal & 50% performance

outline
1. influence of thermodynamic constraints on TPC shape

thermal specialist vs generalist: -ve correlation between TPC-peak (B|pk) ; diff Tk of peak & 50% perfornance (W|op)
phytoplankton growth rate from literatures
phylogenetic regression
very week thermal specialist pattern

2 correlations
-ve slope of rise & optimal Tk
weak correlation between T|op & max performance

body/cell size weekly -ve correlate with peak of TPC
____________
2. evolutionary pattern of thermal sensitivity

___________
3. big picture of thermal adaptation
