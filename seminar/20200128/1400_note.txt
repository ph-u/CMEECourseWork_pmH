Ecosystem services vs climate change
Pollination interact with pest control
- Phenological mismatch
- Floral resource production
- Distribution shift

Flower attractiveness: visual, olfactory (major role in pollinator interaction, sensitive to plant stress)

How drought affect floral traits and then pollinators visit then back to floral propagation
Drought decrease nectar production
Drought not quite impact plant reproduction (fruit, seed, seed per fruit)
More fruit produced in dry conditions

Bee make choices:
Resources equal status?
Competition?
Why decline?

How do floral resources vary under climate change?
Impact on pollinators, then plant comunities?

Behavioural experiments: energy budget, colony fitness...
Habitat enhancement -- mitigation of insect decline

Motivation
Mitigation of insect decline
Sustainable ecosystem services

Pollination ecology
Mechanistic understanding of plant responses to climate change
