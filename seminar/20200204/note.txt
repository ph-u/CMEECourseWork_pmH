predict glob biodiv using glob mechanistic model & neutral model
Lucas

constituent parts, interact following mechanisms
simplicity vs realistic
causal effect invested for emergent patterns
disect vs understand as a whole
Madingly model
- earth in grid
- heterotrophic life in 19 func groups: realm, feeding mode, rep strategy, tthermoreg
- data: env, ocean current, NPP
- periodic N-S motion of biomass
- prediction only right for few locations
- what are important factors not yet in the model?
- no sp-level, eco pattern global scale

neutral model as alt mechanistic model
- neighbour reproduction, speciation, dispersal, extrapiration
- dynamical eqm of spp richness
- good rep patterns from: relativwe sp abund, sp-area relationship
- null model in macroecology
- id assign to individual, not realistic

coupling up two models
- body size guides
- speciation rate as free parameters (high: 10^-5)
- model features linked to discrepancy?
- longevity: off from empirial estimates
- body mass: quite close
- get better estimates on parameters?
- simulating more realistic speciation rates?
- optimize model useful?
- new method for calculating speciation rate?

good model get wrong in right ways
