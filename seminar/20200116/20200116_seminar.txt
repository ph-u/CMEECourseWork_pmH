Managing fisheries to protect dependent predators

How to manage
Managed for fisheries and impact to other downstream components
CCANLR 1982, FAO choice of conduct for responsible fisheries, 1995; CBD Aichi Biodiversity Target 6, 2010
Strategic ambiguity of policy-making
Paper: why ecosystem-based management? 2009

Stakeholders strong support on "feedback management" but measure-effectiveness researches was ignored
Identify solutions, although not knowing which problem was for

Single species management: sustainable population, small impact to later years
Harvest-control rule
Effective, long-lasting field; several decades

Krill: fixed catch limit, no regular stock assessment (conservative, 1% of spawning rate)
Variable > data > estimate + objective/ref point > adjustment method (HCR) > implementation
Target & (soft) limit reference point: ideal aim, how many times allowed to breach in simulation which still achieve final goal

Best management from smallest fisheries but with an authority managing
Lowest score management from pioneer of this concept, determining food source for half of the world's population; policy based on consensus

Fishery managers not predator ref points
1. Uncertain predator objectives
2. Confounding variables apart from fisheries
3. External stress cab be a factor for "failure" of fisheries management
4. Implementation target simple, more attractive & tractable

Predator reference points mostly available
Precautionary measures sometimes effective
Fixed biomass limit from fisheries, 10x predator requirement
Total impact of predator still too big

Adaptive management
Lag time of detectable impact, need leading indicators (e.g. Offspring production)
Limit reference point
Relative reference point: not too hard penalize fisheries for external impacts

Societal choice of how many responsibilities commercial parties should share
Some objectives to complex to achieve for now

Predator well-buffer from short-term prey fluctuation, decouple from predator-prey relationship
Critical habitat availability, breeding sites (snow cover fluctuation, rock-ice ratio)

Scientifically important vs politically favoured
