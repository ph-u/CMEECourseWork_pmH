species similar -> pose more evolutionary pressure on each other -> adaptive radiation
character displacement: similar body size, similar ancestor -> body size divergence
phylogenetic comparative methods
existing methods treat species as independent once they've split

macroevolutionary impacts of species interactions
- are species interactions too weak / fluctuating to leave an imprint?
- are there particular groups be more affected at ocean island organisms?

1. interspecific territoriality (IT) in passerines
- common
- affect species ability to coexist
- drive character displacement (territorial aggression)
- why occur? 1. mistaken recognition; 2. constraint hypothesis: restricted to simple habitats; 3. resource competition (predictors: syntopy, mass diffcavity ...); 4. mating hypothesis
- phylogenetic linear mixed models as solution: fixed effects on interaction + random effect on phylogeny
- more frequent among high syntopy, similar songs, similar plumage
- species pairs phenotypical traits from time since most recent ancestor
- approx 20% IT across families
- probability of IT increases with breeding habitat overlap for non-hybridizing sp pairs, fairly stable high for hybridization pairs
- plumage similarity, song similarity (signal traits) as mediator for IT behaviour
- ancestral resemblance hypothesis

2. competition in tangers (largest songbird group)
- how important is competition in large, continental scale?
- (bad) pattern-based approaches: sympatric vs allopatric (random subset of spp)
- drift can create allopatric pairs by chance: lower power, high Type-1 error
- (not quite work) process-based approach: infer process from pattern observed: easy to define -- brownian motion (drift), ornstein-Uhlenbeck (optimal), early burst (rate vary) [traits evolve independently]
- sympatric repel each other in trait space
- matching competition, diversity dependent (involve interspecific competition)
- ancestral biogeography
- interspecific competition: to resource-use, some species with plumage traits, no for social interaction traits (evolve much faster)

3. Latitudinal gradients in competition
biotic as selective importance in tropics, abiotic for temperate
secondary sympatry requires more time in tropics, sympatric species more divergent
temperate region traits evolve faster
latitudinal models can fit: 1. multi-rate BM models; 2. multi-peak OU model
family-level analyses: niche saturation restrict divergence
- no signal of models fitting spp whether it is living in tropics
- no competitively driven divergence more common in tropics
continental-level analyses: tropics restrict divergence
- slope biases
-- only high trophic level organisms or open habitats, niche saturation
-- no diff between regions: dense habitats, semi-open habitats
-- niche saturation > in temperate: low trophic levels
- eco opportunity drive rapid div traits in temperate lineages partly true
