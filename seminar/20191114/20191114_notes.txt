50% global population at risk of dengue
spatial expansion from coastal to inland
climate, vector population, human society
other mechanisms leading to outbreaks `.`no special patterns with severe dengue cases
mosquito abundance highly seasonal: June to early Oct
sensitivity analysis on model -- combining two mosquito spp not affecting result much
integrated modelling approach: mechanistic + analytical (generalized additive model, GAM)
one month lag between climate & mosquito conditions (weather-abundance correlation)
spatial heterogeneity in ppt-abundance association
susceptical-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model
15d/month as mosquito abundance affecting threshold
epidemic season 4-5 months, end at Sept-Oct
two considering factors: mosquito abundance, per mosquito vector efficiency -- which is dominant? (later one -> transgenetic approach?)
large dispersion in mosquito abundance
estimated population in model `.` observation site changes, observed data less accurate than estimated ones
mosquito abundance as factor to analysis works
backward modelling, use data for callibration of model
simple SIR model `.`need more data for callibration of complex ones
human behaviour (exposure) might also be a contributing factor
spline function
local case drive by climate conditions, imported cases not -- update model by considering imported cases
