consumer-resource interactions in ecology

wide range of model organisms
energy (flow): currency of ecology
functional responses
handling time
type 1: linear
type 2: saturation
type 3: response lag + saturation

capture rate: limit on encounters in space
handling time: limit on physiology

larger & warm animals: higher capture rate, lower handling time (=eat more)
not too well-explained

currently too much pseudo-replications across researches on model organisms

categorical predictors
active vs passive encounter strategies
skewed data towards mobile, filter feeders

mutual interference
density of predators increase, resource not decreased
ratio- / prey- / predator-dependent models?
similar conclusion between competing models

response scaled with body size?
subtle effect: ^pred, ^capture rate
encounter rate: forage over volume > over surface --> consider interaction in space

physical structure modify consumer-resource interactions
behaviour changes when environment changes

sub-optimal foraging when there is a large resource pool
small spatial scale -> collapse of hump-shape curve in log capture rate from drifting -> simple structure -> complex structure
interaction changes temporally, spatially & habitat complexity

human change habitat context without understanding consequences

lots of covariating factors on habitat structure manipulation using natural ingredients

refuge space creation -- artificial precise change minimizing confounding factors in covariation effect
hard to control refuge space technically

3-D printing create precise habitat
printing time scales with length of print

interaction difference between species pairs
increase in obstacle density, decrease in capture rate (`.`refuge space)

available data limits what we can know:
metabolic predictors well established
model species and systems skew limited global data
modifiers of encounter rates are key
structure cannot be understood without new data

currently not collecting data with sufficient attributes to understand interactions

high turnover trials for collecting data points
artifact of model-fitting

survey works on whale functional response (more course)
data can be quite skewed

aquatic food-webs are nested
not enough data to quantify effect

boundary effect on functional response changes?

seagrass habitat complex: complexity changes with predator size & foraging mode
active-capture predators more eye-catching for data
obligate sit-and-wait predators encounter less resource than other groups?

lack of pairwise data
