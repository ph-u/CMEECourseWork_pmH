nested subgenomic 3 = lots of transcripted genes from RHS of genome
coronavirus: RNA large genome virus
large genome: mutation rate not high, unusual for RNA virus
spike protein variations
anti-defensive proteins from virus (vs anti-viral protein in host cells)
tissue tropism =/= serverity
0.1% death rate = low, not pathogenic
lots of coronavirus in bats -- natural reservior
mortality rate not well-correlated with tissue tropism (can get into the cell, =/= reproducing)
pathogenicity can be caused by small amino acid changes or loss or genes

MERS: from bats through camel to human
wear gloves, don't touch mouth, hard to get infected

bats
high population density
common food resource
long-lived

virus recombination
non-homologous, hard to recombine
SARS2 similar genome with SARS1

more difficult to be asymptomatic
