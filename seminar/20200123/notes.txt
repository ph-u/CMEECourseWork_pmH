Skewed distribution of sensitivity, some super tolerant
Boltzmann-Arrihenieus plot
Same thermal constraints across lineages
Ecoinformatics data collection: plot digitization
0.65 global average on thermal sensitivity
Bacteria and archaea have higher than normal average
Thermal sensitivity of respiration: higher in dense microbe
Linking short-long term TPC: higher better (mesophiles) / equalisation (extremophiles) / weak biochemical adaptation; cut off at 45C
Species thermo-sorting in environment have community effect?
200gen E.coli adapt +7C temperature change
Thermal change lead to lineage adaptation or species composition changes? -> restorable microbial community
Quick shock of temperature: env change independent from evolution
Ecosystem impacts -> ecosystem respiration [flux] (autotrophic [eukaryotes + plants] + heterotrophic eukaryotes + heterotrophic prokaryotes): unit = eV
Hard to parametrize
High T_pk = Firmucutes
Firmucutes: r-specislist
Proteobacteria: K-specialist
Exp't warning studies: v alpha-ptbact; ^ Firmucutes
