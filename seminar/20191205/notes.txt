bird demographics
spatial structure

observational methods
correlation or causation?

record interaction
deduce social network

use data permutations as null models
do this for every sites every weekend
test statistic

control feeder response to the bird types
number-tagged -- odd / even access feeders

study methods
wytham woods
examining sociality

social bonds: foraging
pre-experimental period: no assortment by tag type
experimental period
1. highly non-random assormentby tag type
2. where they can feed = interactions
monitored new food patches
network diffusion analysis
more close to the forced groups in exp't period

foraging segregation influence site prospecting? yes
winter foraging flocks -> spring breeding patterns? yes
social choice depend on where they were during winter
neighbour: stronger winter bonds
mated pairs: compatible vs conflicting pairs
conflicting pairs spend more time on areas at prohibited feeders
male personal +ve affect mate bond strength
bold males spend much more time with partner & earlier meeting partner

repeatable social phenotypes

how bond affect fitness?
degree : count num of social bonds; 40% repeatability
strength: tightness of social bonds; 25% repeatability
consistency of social bonds yearly
annual 50% flock turnover rate

birds reponse to losing flockmates
losing past flock mates -> more new & strong social bonds

betweenness: how well a group is bridged to another group
clustering: how well do group members are connected
simple social behaviour better predicted by direct metric simulations
problem solvers netwoek positions differ from non-solvers?
juvenile birds: non-solvers strong and few links
average: solvers weak and many links
simple behaviour: solver spread info faster `.` more connections

complex behavioiur: solvers slower
