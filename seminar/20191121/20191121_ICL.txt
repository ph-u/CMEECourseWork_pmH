Shift in biological events: e.g. Flowering
Phenological mismatch: e.g. Flowering in non-pollinator period
Negative fitness effect
Less studied demographic impact


Reproduction timing
Annual life cycle
Optimal switching time between somatic and reproductive part
Investment trade-off between expansion and production


Models
1. Seasonal variation in production rate
2. Demographic responses
3. Resource competition
4. Interspecific competition
General graphic shape function
Growth capacity & productivity peak date : unchanged as an active response
Many factors leading to deviation from ideal exponential growth rate
Increase productivity, reproduce earlier
Not gaining much from growing, reproduce earlier
Colony growth, consumption rate levels off -> high nutrition reproduce earlier


Resource- colony establishment feedback, 3 optima
Cheaters use more resources if investment on reproduction more than optimal


Shift in day of reproduction because initial state deviated from optional
Later flowering period, later and smaller reproductive growth
